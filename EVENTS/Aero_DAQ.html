   <h3>2020 Collegiate Design Series SAE Aero Design Rules</h3>
 </header>
 <p>According to the competition manual: </p>

 <p>SAE Aero Design consists of three competition classes: Regular class, Advanced class and Micro class. Regular class traces its lineage back to the very beginning of Aero Design, when it was created as a heavy lift competition for model aircraft. For 2020, Regular class has a new theme: teams are asked to develop a bush plane design that can operate from short runways while carrying outsized cargo as well as other cargo. The customer needs to transport many large spherical storage tanks to very remote locations, with short runways. Normal aircraft cannot perform this task and helicopters are too expensive and lack sufficient range. Additional constraints provided by the customer include: a 100 ft runway limit, a 120-inch wingspan limit, and a 1000-watt limiter. </p>

 <p>Advanced class continues with the theme from 2018-2019 of colonizing a planet by delivering “colonists”, “supplies”, and “habitats”. “The “colonists” are delivered to a designated zone using a small autonomous glider, carried by the primary aircraft and released in a designated area. The primary aircraft also delivers the “habitats” and “supplies”. The previous year also saw the implementation of a 750-watt limiter. For 2020, the wingspan limit for the primary aircraft has been reduced to 132 inches. </p>

   <h3>Key design objectives of subteam avionics</h3>
 </header>
 <p>The ultimate task fell upon us was to develop a comprehensive data aquisition system that demostrates the key parameters of our designed aircraft while it's in the air.
 The work was divided into two main sections with one on the software side and another being related to hardwares. Although my personal focus was mainly on the latter, the final product of our ground station can be visualized by the following picture.</p>

<p>In order to deliver the aquired parameters accurately, we chose Arduino as the platform where we intergrated all sensors to simultaneously extract the values of altitude, orientation, location, and so on. </p>

<p>That being said, such work of integration might not be ealiy achieved. Owing to certain specifications of our sensors in use, we ended up running multiple Arduino timers to make sure the different hardware pieces work perfectly in parallel.
The final connection scheme is shown below. </p>

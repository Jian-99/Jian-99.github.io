   <h3>Key design objectives of subteam avionics</h3>
 </header>
 <p>The ultimate task that fell upon us was to develop a comprehensive data aquisition system that demostrates the key parameters of our designed aircraft while it's in the air.
 The work was divided into two main sections with one on the software side and another being related to hardwares. Although my personal focus was mainly on the latter, the final product of our ground station can be visualized by the following picture.</p>

<p>In order to deliver the aquired parameters accurately, we chose Arduino as the platform where we intergrated all sensors to simultaneously extract the values of altitude, orientation, location, and so on. </p>

<p>That being said, such work of integration might not be ealiy achieved. Owing to certain specifications of our sensors in use, we ended up running multiple Arduino timers to make sure the different hardware pieces work perfectly in parallel.
The final connection scheme is shown below. </p>

  <h3>Competition Results</h3>
</header>
<p>Since non-essential international travel to the US was banned due to COVID-19, the competition was delivered in an online format which, I believe, significantly relied on the presentation and two rounds of test flight results.
Anyway, our design team won the 1st and the 3rd place in Regular Class and Advanced Class respectively. All competition results from the past years can be found here: </p>

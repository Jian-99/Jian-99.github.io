   <h3>Backgroud and Context</h3>
 </header>

<p>The strength and coverage of Wi-Fi signals vary in an indoor environment due to physical barriers such as walls, as well as other forms of interference. 
  This often results in the home occupant experiencing weak Wi-Fi signals at specific locations of the house, 
  depending on the setup of the router and boosters. Given the current “work from home” situation due to COVID-19, 
  the ability to remotely assess the strength of the signal inside a home is important for occupants and a major concern for network providers. 
</p>

<p>There are already pre-existing applications that allow measuring Wi-Fi signal strength by running the app at specific locations of the house. However, the usability of them is greatly limited due to the uncertainty of the data in the mapping process and the counterintuitive user interface. In addition, most Wi-Fi measuring apps are only providing data at one location, which does not provide users with the necessary information needed to determine the size of the area that has valid Wi-Fi coverage. 
</p>

<p>To facilitate this, Augmented Reality (AR) can be used to overlay this information on to a 2D floor map model of the space. The latter may be generated via LiDAR data, which is becoming widely available on devices such as iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro. A coherent LiDAR system captures the amplitude and phase of the returning signal and accounts for laser return time to generate a 3D model of the home surroundings. The 3D LiDAR data will be utilized to create a 2D floor map that shows the strength of Wi-Fi around the entire indoor environment of the house. This will help internet providers improve the overall internet coverage by deciding where to place routers and boosters, optimizing strength of the Wi-Fi signal inside houses.
</p>

<p>This project will be focused on creating an application utilizing the LiDAR sensors found on the iPad Pro. The advantage this brings that preexisting apps currently do not have is the ability to generate floor plan models and provide accurate indoor positioning for heatmap generation. With LiDAR, we believe it would be possible to integrate both of these attributes together and provide a seamless experience to users surveying sites for Wi-Fi heatmaps.

  <h3>Current Progress</h3>
</header>

<p>For the heatmap generation, we have moved from retrieving raw Wi-Fi signal strength data to Wi-Fi speed measurement since Apple obscures the former. 
  The core application interface has been laid out, and now we are working to maximize the accuarcy of scanning/reconstruction of the tested rooms.

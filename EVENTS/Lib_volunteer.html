Being extremely grateful, I always wanted to find an opportunity to give something back to my community where I was born and grew up. Finally, I had this amazing chance to
chat with these amazing kids while playing games, leading them to go through a children's English book, drawing with their unbounded imagination. It really reminds of numberous fun moments when I was learning English as a child.

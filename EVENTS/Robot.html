   <h3>Electrical Engineering Design Studio Project II</h3>
 </header>
 <p>The objective of the project entails the software and hardware design of an autonomous coin- picking robot. Design stages include the building, programming, and testing of the prototype, along with the implementation of extra functionalities,
   with an allocated work time of a few weeks. Below are the further detailed requirements for the project: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Understand the use of PWM (pulse-width modulation) to control servo motors</li>
      <li>Successfully build a magnet using concepts in electromagnetism</li>
      <li>Constructing a microcontroller board (soldering, designing, and testing)</li>
      <li>Creation and maintenance of makefiles to compile, link, and load code onto hardware</li>
    </ul>

 <p>This project report attached below provides documentation on the architecture and design of an autonomous coin picking robot prototype by students of Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC).
    Entailed is a detailed account of our design process, including idea generation, data collection, problem specification, solution assessment,
   and full illustrations of our design and how we applied appropriate engineering knowledge to do so.
   This document is written with the criteria of being addressed towards a reasonably expert reader in the field of engineering such as a project manager.</p>

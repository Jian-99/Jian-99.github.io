<p>Since we are now officially registered for the 2020 SAE Aerodesign West Regular & Advanced Class Competitions, inspiring experiments are going on during our scheduled meeting on every Saturday.
   Specifically, in my sub-team Avionics, we are building a data acquisition system (DAS) that gathers data of altitude, air pressure, air speed, location, temperature, and the orientation of the plane. With data transmitted to our ground station,
    our plane can be controlled accordingly in the air to satisfy the competition requirements.</p>

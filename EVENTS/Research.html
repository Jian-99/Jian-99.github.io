 		<h2>Heading with a Subtitle</h2>
 		<p>Subtitle text is italicized</p>
 	</header>
 	<p>This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle, most commonly referred to as: the paragraph. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>

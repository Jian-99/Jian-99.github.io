    <h3>Facial Attributes</h3>
  </header>
  <p>As an essential part of human bodies, human faces vary in several ways.
    In the scope of anthro- pology, this may be caused by different food, water sources, climates, languages during the march of evolution,
    and even social achievement/economic growth in modern days (Mehrotra 1997). According to the researchers at the University of California (Berkeley),
     the variation among faces is quite significant comparing humans to most of the other creatures.</p>

This section involves the programming language of Python, TensorFlow, and Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV).
For the purpose of keeping the codes light and clean, I used Anaconda-Navigator on macOS as suggested in Practical Machine Learning and Image Processing (Singh 2019).
After installing the related packages, our journey begins.</p>

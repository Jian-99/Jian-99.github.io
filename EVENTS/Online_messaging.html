<p> A Web Application was developed to serve for online messaging. 
  On the client site, all the chat rooms and respective messages were obtained from MongoDB database and rendered dynamically. 
  Thus, when an active user is sending a message to the chat, it gets broadcasted to all the users in this chat and also stored in database. 
  On the server side, session cookies protect resources from unauthorized accessing.
  Finally, a JavaScript sanitization mechanism was implemented to defend the users against Cross-Site Scripting attacks.</p>

   <h3>An Analysis on the Development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</h3>
 </header>
 <p>Our report discusses the development of modern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, also known as drones, which are automatic aircraft controlled by remotes and on-ground control stations. Our analysis focuses on the perspectives of drone history, principles of operation, common applications, relevant technologies, advantages and disadvantages, and possible improvement.</p>
 <p>from a simple idea during World War I, UAVs set foot on a long path of innovation and development. Over 100 years, due to the breakthrough in aerodynamics and electrical engineering, the sizes and shapes of drones took a significant change as well as the purposes they have been serving. That makes it another classical example of technology transformation from military to civil. </p>
 <p>Nowadays, drones and their variations have profoundly improved the quality of our lives by delivering packages in 30 mins, capturing exciting aerial video footage, and tracking livestock and the growth of crops etc. On the contrary, as killing machines, they are also known for their efficiency and dramatic effect on the battlefields. </p>
 <p>Although the ethical dilemma remains, the discussion on further improvement and integration of new technology with UAVs continues. With future achievement in miniaturization and autonomy, more categories and functionalities are expected from drones. </p>
